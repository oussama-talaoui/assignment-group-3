## About the project

This project is an opportunity to work on and explore a topic area of interest, and create data science oriented report for communicating our insights. As a team, we had to decide what datasets we want to explore, and how we can present that information while following these steps:

- [X] Describing our domain of interest
- [ ] Articulating pertinent questions in our chosen domain
- [ ] Identifying, downloading, and describing at least 3 datasets related to that domain

## Domain of interest

- [ ] Why are you interested in this field/domain?
- [ ] What other examples of data driven project have you found related to this domain (share at least 3)?
- [ ] What data-driven questions do you hope to answer about this domain (share at least 3)?

* Questions related to field
  + What is the probability of falling in default payment on credit cards?
  + How does the probability of default payment vary by categories of different demographic variables?
  + What are the most important personal features that a bank take into account to concede a credit?


* Questions that can be answer with the dataset
  + Which are the socio-demographics features that can explain falling in default payment on credits cards?
  + How is the behavior of the historical payments according to the educational level?
  + The fact of having different kinds of loans (personal or housing) show any association with falling in default payment on credits?
