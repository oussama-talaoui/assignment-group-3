## About the project

This project is an opportunity to work on and explore a topic area of interest, and create data science oriented report for communicating our insights. As a team, we had to decide what datasets we want to explore, and how we can present that information while following these steps:

- [X] Describing our domain of interest.
- [X] Articulating pertinent questions in our chosen domain.
- [X] Identifying, downloading, and describing at least 3 datasets related to that domain.

## Domain of interest

- [X] Why are we interested in **The banking domain**?
  
  The banking sector is increasingly getting related to our daily life aspects: shopping, online purchasing, saving etc. The data available from that usage identifies specific types of consumers and business spending behaviors that can be explored to show customer spending patterns, predictions and fraud.

- [X] What other examples of data driven projects have we found related to this domain (share at least 3)?
   + Credit Card Fraud Detection (Identifying fraudulent credit card transactions).
   + Classification of credit card transactions.
   + Predicting Credit Card Balance.
- [X] What data-driven questions do we hope to answer about this domain (share at least 3)?

* Questions related to our field
  + What is the probability of falling in default payment on credit cards?
  + How does the probability of default payment vary by categories of different demographic variables?
  + What are the most important personal features that a bank take into account to concede a credit?


* Questions that can be answer with the dataset
  + Which are the socio-demographics features that can explain falling in default payment on credits cards?
  + How is the behavior of the historical payments according to the educational level?
  + The fact of having different kinds of loans (personal or housing) show any association with falling in default payment on credits?
